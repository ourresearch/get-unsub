                B. How We Use Personal Information
            </div>
            <p>
                We will only use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws. Most commonly, we will use the categories of personal information identified above for the following business purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the provision of our Covered Products and Services or the operation of our business or a third party’s business. All of our employees and contractors are required to follow our data privacy and security policies when handling personal information.</li>
                <li>Where we need to perform a contract that we have entered into with you, or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.</li>
                <li>To protect the security and integrity of our business, or our Covered Products and services.</li>
                <li>Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).</li>
                <li>Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.</li>
                <li>For compliance with legal obligations and protection of Unsub and others. Specifically, we may be required to use and retain personal information for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime; loss prevention; or fraud. We may also use personal information to meet our internal and external audit requirements, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (i) under applicable law, which may include laws outside your country of residence; (ii) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence; (iii) to enforce or apply our contractual rights; and (iv) to otherwise protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.</li>
                <li>For marketing purposes. Specifically, we may use your personal information (including cookies – for more information on how we use cookies, please see Section 1.D below) to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You may receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased products or services from us, we have identified similar products or services that may be relevant for you and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. We will get your express opt-in consent before we market products or services to you that are not similar to products or services you have purchased from us before, or if we share your personal information with any company outside the Unsub group of companies for marketing purposes. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time. If you receive a marketing communication from us, the communication will contain an option to opt-out of further communications. If you receive a marketing communication from one of our business partners, or from social media providers, you should opt out with that entity directly. You can also contact us at any time to opt out using the details given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</li>
